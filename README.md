Originally, I set out to create a fun profile picture editor where users could add silly filters to their photos. But as I worked, inspiration struck, why not turn it into an interactive "Who Ate the Cookies?" mystery game instead? After hours of redesigning, I transformed the concept into a playful detective story where players interview suspicious puppies, uncover hilarious alibis (like rainbow pooping dogs!), and solve the cookie theft. The final version keeps the funny murder mystery vibe while maintaining clean code and a simple, user-friendly design. 


WHO ATE THE COOKIE??
